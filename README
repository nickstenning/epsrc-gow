# [EPSRC Past Grant portfolio](http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/SearchPastGrant.aspx)

As of 2011-03-08, the EPSRC "Grants on the Web" database contains grants dating back to 1985:

- 35,966 grants
- Â£6,055,173,655 of committed funding

This repository contains tools for scraping and manipulating this data into a useful format.

## Quick access

Instead of using the code in this repository, why not download the database generated by it? A listing of these can be found [at CKAN](http://storage.ckan.net/epsrc-gow).

- [Latest database](http://storage.ckan.net/epsrc-gow/grants-20110308.tbz2) (updated 2011-03-08)

## Usage

To get a YAML dump of basic grants information for the financial year beginning 1 Apr 1993, run:

    $ ruby bin/getpastgrants.rb 1993 > epsrc_gow_fy1993.yaml

More usefully, to download all the information in the EPSRC GOW repository year by year, one might run:

    $ mkdir scrape
    $ for y in $(seq 1985 2011); do
        ruby bin/getpastgrants.rb $y > scrape/epsrc_gow_fy${y}.yaml
      done

Each grant has a unique grant reference, e.g. `GR/N15764/01`. A useful printable identifier for this grant is the SHA1 hash of this string, i.e. in this case: `6062dba6d3f0cbc12172193f612d1ef4ea91a533`.

To extract the grants into a flat-file database of JSON files in `grants/`, run:

    $ mkdir grants
    $ cat scrape/*.yaml | ruby bin/extractscrape.rb grants

After this command, the example grant above will be found in

    grants/60/6062dba6d3f0cbc12172193f612d1ef4ea91a533.json

We provide a tool for pretty printing the contents of this file quickly (which assumes your database is in `grants/`):

    $ ruby lookup.rb GR/N15764/01

## Warnings

This scraper needs a lot of work. At the moment we're only scraping the most basic information about these grants.

## Dependencies

You'll need:

- ruby, obviously
- the `hpricot`, `mechanize`, and `json` gems
